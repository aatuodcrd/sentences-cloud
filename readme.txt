Sentence Cloud Project

Overview

This project uses Flask to create a web application that displays a word cloud based on sentences grouped by similarity. The sentences are processed, grouped based on their similarity, and a word cloud is generated on the frontend using the WordCloud.js library.

File Structure

project_sentence_cloud/
│
├── templates/
│   └── index.html        # HTML template for rendering word cloud
├── main.py               # Flask application script
└── requirement.txt       # Python dependencies

Requirements

To run this project, you’ll need to install the following Python dependencies:
	•	Flask==3.1.0

To install the requirements, run:

pip install -r requirement.txt

Running the Project
	1.	Clone or download the project files.
	2.	Navigate to the project directory.
	3.	Install the required dependencies using the command above.
	4.	Start the Flask app by running the following command:

python main.py

	5.	Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to view the Sentence Cloud.

How it Works
	•	The backend (Flask) processes the list of sentences (sentences_list), groups them based on their similarity, and counts the occurrences of each unique sentence.
	•	The data is passed to the frontend (HTML template) as JSON.
	•	The WordCloud.js library generates a word cloud based on the sentence frequencies.
	•	The more frequent the sentence, the larger it appears in the cloud.

Modifications

You can modify the sentences_list in main.py to use your own set of sentences. Additionally, the threshold for grouping similar sentences can be adjusted by changing the threshold parameter in the group_similar_sentences function.
